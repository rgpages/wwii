			<p>It was on D-Day. June 6, 1944.</p>
			<p>Heurgue was a 14-year-old French citizen visiting his sister in Boston when war broke out in Europe in 1939. France would fall to Nazi Germany the following year.</p>
			<p>Heurgue, now an 89-year-old Eugene resident, joined the U.S. Army as the best way to get back to his homeland. On D-Day, he joined thousands of other paratroopers with the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions who gazed down from the door of a C-47 cargo plane before jumping into a night sky filled with peril and uncertainty.</p>
			<p>“That was my way of going home,” he said. “It was somewhat different for me.”</p>
			<p>For more than 150,000 Allied troops who followed by sea — in the largest amphibious landing in history — Normandy was hardly home. It was a foreign land they’d been tasked to liberate.</p>

			<p>D-Day has been memorialized in books, television and film. For local residents who found themselves on and off the beaches during and after the invasion of Normandy, however, its scale and significance can’t be overstated.</p>
			<p>Wars between nation-states on giant battlefields and across wide fronts appear to be of another era for a nation that has spent more than a decade fighting terrorists and insurgents hiding in plain sight among civilian populations.</p>
			<p>“There will never be anything like (D-Day),” said Heur­gue, who would see for himself the hundreds of ships anchored off the Normandy coast three days after his jump.</p>
			<p>“It was,” he said, “something incredible.”</p>

			<p>This link to America’s “Greatest Generation” is fading rapidly. World War II veterans are dying at a rate of more than 550 a day, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
			<p>With the 70th anniversary approaching, The Register-Guard set out to reconnect with more than a dozen World War II veterans in Lane County who had earlier indicated some tie to D-Day.</p>
			<p>The newspaper had profiled these veterans — the youngest, like Heur­gue, are now in their late 80s — in a special series 2½ years ago commemorating the 70th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
			<p>Three of them have died since then, including one just last month.</p>
			<p>Invariably, the others who were interviewed recently remarked how much society had changed since the nation mobilized to fight WWII.</p>
			<p>One has to doubt that D-Day, the success of which hinged on secrecy to avoid alerting the Nazis to troop buildup in Britain and the targeted landing locations, would even be possible in a era of satellite imagery and instant communication.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>“I think nowadays about how much was accomplished in that time,” said Sally Lou Bonzer, a 95-year-old Eugene resident. “How much since that time everything has moved so far faster forward. It’s sort of scary.</p>
			<p>“I have great-­grandchildren, and I wonder what on earth will happen in their time. Everything is different.”</p>
			<p>Bonzer was one of the first Army nurses to step foot on French soil, four days after D-Day. She remembered the dead bodies floating in the water.</p>
			<p>Bonzer would spend a year in Europe, working at a field hospital and patching up troops injured on the front.</p>
			<p>Her most vivid memories aren’t of the injured soldiers she tended. An operating room nurse, she was used to those bloody scenes.</p>
			<p>Rather, there are memories of the dead cows and lost dogs that littered the open fields where the field hospital was set up. Or the apprehension that gripped her walking to the latrine or recovery tent in pitch dark — “You couldn’t see a hand in front of your face,” she remembered — knowing she was exposed to German fire.</p>

		<h2>Fortune smiles and frowns</h2>
		
		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>The luck of the draw is a deep vein that runs through the stories these veterans share.</p>
			<p>Heurgue, the French-born paratrooper, noted that many who jumped on D-Day were killed by German fire or landed in swamps and drowned due to the weight of their gear.</p>
			<p>“You either were lucky or unlucky,” said Heur­gue, who walked into Sainte-Mère-Église, the first French town liberated by Allied forces, the morning after D-Day.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>He was lucky. So was Kenneth Hatlelid, now 94 and living in Eugene.</p>
			<p>Hatlelid, who landed at Utah Beach a week after D-Day, had several close scrapes. He did reconnaissance for a tank destroyer company, scouting out the terrain and directing fire if German tanks were spotted.</p>
			<p>A sniper shot the loop off his belt. He survived the blast of an artillery shell while huddled under his armored vehicle.</p>
			<p>A German plane with its bomb bay doors wide open made a pass over his tank column three times before flying away.</p>
			<p>“We think they didn’t know if it was a German column or an American column,” he said. “That’s what saved us.”</p>
			<p>He’s seen the re-­enactments of D-Day and the ensuring battles captured by film. Most of it is “strictly Hollywood,” he said.</p>
			<p>“They have to make a better story,” he added.</p>

			<p>Another story: Merrill McKern, a 94-year-old Eugene resident, was a radioman aboard a destroyer providing fire support off Utah Beach.</p>
			<p>Two days after D-Day, he picked up an unusual signal and jammed it. He suspects it was a glide bomb dropped from a German bomber and acquiring a target. Jamming that signal, he said, likely saved an Allied ship.</p>
			<p>McKern returned stateside later that year, but the memory and emotion of D-Day have stayed with him to this day. He lamented that he’ll never have the chance to return to Normandy, where white crosses cover several cemeteries to honor the fallen.</p>

			<p>American WWII veterans continue to be laid to rest, albeit at a declining rate now, with more than 1.1 million remaining, according to VA estimates. A million of them have died in the last four years, the estimates show.</p>
			<p>The Telegraph newspaper in Great Britain reported in January that the Normandy Veterans Association, which started in Britain in 1981, will disband after the anniversary because its membership has declined.</p>
			<p>“Members are dropping off the perch, and this is sad, but inevitable,” George Batts, the association’s national secretary, told the newspaper. “Many of the ones we’ve got left are in nursing homes, and a lot are in their 90s.</p>
			<p>“We haven’t done bad, and it is a miracle that public interest in the events themselves hasn’t dimmed.”</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>The last WWII veteran profiled in the The Register-­Guard’s special series, Ted Schwartz of Florence, died from complications of pneumonia on Oct. 27. He was 96.</p>
			<p>The other two profiled D-Day veterans who have died since are Taylor Ramsey, 95, who landed on Utah Beach, and Dennis McLarin, 94, who served aboard the USS Bayfield as it disembarked troops during the invasion.</p>

			<p>Jim Jordan, Schwartz’s son-in-law who served in the Air Force during peacetime, said the significance of D-Day on World War II and his father-in-law’s role in it is not lost on him.</p>
			<p>“I know it was necessary,” he said. “I think it launched the U.S. into being a very powerful country. It brought us out of the Great Depression.”</p>
			<p>D-Day was a crucial offensive in World War II, opening up a western European front against the Nazis just as the massive Soviet army was moving rapidly against Germany from the east.</p>
			<p>U.S. and British military and political leaders agonized and argued for months over how, where and when to launch the seaborne invasion.</p>

			<p>Rugh was a gunner aboard the destroyer USS Walke, which participated in the Normandy invasion and later several invasions in the Pacific Theater.</p>
			<p>The destroyer was damaged badly in January 1945 when a kamikaze slammed into it. Rugh was the only man in his gun mount to survive the attack; he was burned on his face and hands trying to extinguish a fellow sailor who was on fire, said his wife of 65 years, Jean.</p>
